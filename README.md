### Ahoy, code lovers! :wave:	

#### My passion is creating stories, for machines and humans alike. :robot: :mage:

I'm currently taking time off and making space for the next step in my career by digging Ruby (on Rails) and chasing quests at [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/izkreny).

_Also, I'm delighted to support and empower people in their everyday encounters with technology of all shapes and sizes.
I likewise love to look behind the curtains searching for the hidden details and underlying patterns with only one mission: to make life easier, prettier, and funnier for everyone.
Last, but not the least, I always have strong communication & interpersonal skills and a great eye for user experience & interface design as faithful allies by my side._
